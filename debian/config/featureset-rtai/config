# Kernel config for RTAI 4.0, x86                              -*-conf-*-
#

# This config should be applied on top of a generic kernel config to,
# hopefully, create a working configuration for a RTAI-patched
# kernel.

# x86 kernel configuration
# http://www.xenomai.org/index.php/Configuring_x86_kernels
#
# Do not disable power management globally, the only configuration
# options which should be disabled in this area are:
#
# CONFIG_APM is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR is not set
#
# This option creates issues with Xenomai timing code, as well as
# unpredictable run-time for your tasks, and possibly high latencies
# when changing frequency:
#
# CONFIG_CPU_FREQ is not set
#
# This can cause big latency spikes:
#
# CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR is not set
#
# The option CONFIG_PCI_MSI should be turned off. For more details,
# see the thread at:
# https://mail.gna.org/public/adeos-main/2008-08/threads.html
#
# CONFIG_PCI_MSI is not set

#
# Just like CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR, this idle driver sends the CPU into
# deep C states, also causing huge latencies because the APIC timer
# that Xenomai uses may not fire anymore.

# CONFIG_INTEL_IDLE is not set
